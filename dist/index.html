I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,
    if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s
    worth.

“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
    looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
    experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
    incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the
    best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
    I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
    startup. ”

Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting
    guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.
</h2> <p class="text-White text-sm opacity-50">
“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really
    refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go
    out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The
    standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need
    from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”

Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed
    some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by
    step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only
    say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
    not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
    assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took
    my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
    fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
    developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
    developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
